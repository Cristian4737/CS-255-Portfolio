Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
This project is for DriverPass a driver training company. The purpose is to provide online motor vehicle driver classes and tests for their customers. With optional scheduled physical on-the-road driving training to help customers better prepare for DMV driving testing and licensing. The main client was Liam, the owner of the company.

What did you do particularly well?
I enjoyed creating the the UML documents for this course. I had prior experience with class diagrams but being able to use and understand use-case and sequence diagrams will help me throughout my career as a software engineer. Lucidchart is a great tool and I had a great time using it. Ultimately, I am happy with the work I produced for this class although I had difficulties in my personal life the disrupted my work flow. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to revise my business requirement document. Honestly, it was written very quickly with minimal forethough put into the actual pratical use of what I was making. The idea of these projects is to emulate what we will see in the real world but I was unable gain much experience from project one as I was simply making sure to provide work that meet the rubric expectations. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user needed a solution, that was centralized in its focus to allow them to manage there business and provide a service to customers. The first part of any development is to receive requirements from the user and then refine those requirements and create the documents necessary to begin development. Without these crucial steps taking place then development will be full of delays, errors and inconsistencies. Ultimatley, making sure that the expectations of the users is meet is not only the most important part of the SDLC life cycle, its process must be vigourous and extensive in its nature. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Using diagrams to model systems is the best solution to actually creating a system before developing it. Ofcourse there will be changes made along the way, but seeing how a system is supposed to work before it actually does is essential. This removes guesswork for the developers and ensure the products created are to the specification expected. I like to think of software development as a colony of ants. Alone an ant cannot do much, together many ants can accomplish amazing feats, and thats what a SDLC is. People coming together to ensure the sucessful implemenation and design of a system.
